**What We Learned**
While building this project, we embarked on our first full-stack journey as a team — transitioning from frontend development to working with the backend. The experience was both challenging and rewarding, and we grew significantly throughout the process:

**Frontend Development:** As we worked on the user interface, we encountered various bugs and styling issues. Through collaboration and research, we learned how to use React hooks like useState and useEffect, along with styling libraries like Bootstrap and Reactstrap, to create a responsive and user-friendly design.

**Backend Integration:** Setting up the Express server and connecting it to MongoDB was a new experience for most of us. We learned how to create APIs, set up routes and controllers, and handle server-side logic effectively. Despite initial difficulties, we gradually became more confident in managing the backend.

**Working with React Tools:****** We explored tools such as React Router DOM for page navigation and useContext for state management. These tools helped us create a more seamless user experience and made our codebase more organized and scalable.

**Deployment & Environment Configuration:** Deploying our backend and frontend taught us how to manage production environments, configure HTTPS, and ensure security. We also explored using CI/CD pipelines for smoother deployment processes.

**Version Control Practices:** Using Git throughout the project taught us how important version control is — not just for tracking code changes, but also for collaborating efficiently and rolling back safely when necessary.

**Problem-Solving Together:** Every obstacle we faced became a learning opportunity. We developed a stronger team dynamic by troubleshooting issues together, dividing tasks based on our strengths, and supporting each other throughout the development cycle.

**Big-Picture Thinking:** Most importantly, we gained insight into how a real-world application comes together — from UI to server logic to deployment — and how different parts of a system need to work in harmony.

This project was a major milestone in our academic journey and has equipped us with the foundational skills and teamwork experience needed for future development challenges.
